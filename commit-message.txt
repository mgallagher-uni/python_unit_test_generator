[WIP] Initial test directory and file generation

First implementation of a test directory and test file generator.

- Takes a path of a file directory
- Generates a corresponding test directory
- Test files structure analogous to original directory
- For each .py file a test file is generated
- For each class and function in the file a test function is generated.
- Very basic initial implementation.
